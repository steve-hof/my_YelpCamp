#YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a fictional website where users log in to suggest, rank, and blog about campsites. It is serving as the learning space for me to explore the MEAN Stack, the concepts of REST, and many other full stack web development techniques. YelpCamp is one of the projects taught by the Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy.

This is still very much a work in progress.
